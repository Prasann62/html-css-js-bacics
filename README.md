# HTML / CSS / JS Basics

A collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript example files — simple web-page experiments and demos to learn and practice frontend fundamentals.

## 📄 What this repo contains

A set of standalone HTML/CSS/JS files demonstrating various basic web-development concepts: layout, styling, responsive design, JavaScript behavior, and simple page structures.  
Some sample files are:  
- Simple static pages using only HTML & CSS  
- Examples using CSS Flexbox / layout  
- Pages combining HTML, CSS, and JS (for basic interactions)  
- Sample “portfolio / demo” style pages

## Purpose / Motivation

This repository is aimed at beginners — to serve as a playground to practise and understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in building web pages.  

It’s a lightweight, no-framework, minimal setup — perfect for learning basics — without the overhead of build tools or complex setups.

## How to Use / Run

1. Clone or download the repo.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prasann62/html-css-js-bacics.git

Simply open any .html file in your browser.

Explore the code (HTML / CSS / JS) to understand how layout, style, and behavior are implemented.

Modify or experiment — change CSS, HTML structure or add JS, to see how it affects the page.

Potential Improvements / To-Do (for future)

Add README descriptions or comments inside each HTML/CSS/JS file to explain key concepts.

Group examples into subfolders (e.g. layout/, css/, js/, bootstrap/) for better organization.

Add a simple navigation/index page — listing all examples with previews or links.

Add responsive/mobile-friendly versions for pages.

Maybe add more advanced examples as you learn more (animations, DOM manipulation, small interactive apps).
Who Is This For / Who Can Benefit

Beginners learning web development.

Anyone wanting quick reference or simple templates for static pages.

Students or hobbyists experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript without frameworks.
